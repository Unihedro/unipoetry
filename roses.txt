roses are red
violets are blue
poems are gay
and so are you 

also... congratulations. Now don’t worry, a lot of my friends are gay, and all of them are really cool, so you’re in good company. I just thought you might like to be told as early as possible so that you can start preparing to make the proper life adjustments. If you’re already gay, then you’ve got nothing to worry about - carry on as you are. If you weren’t gay before, you may want to consult the nearest gay for advice on how to live from now on. Hopefully you’ll find it an enriching and enjoyable experience, and nothing to be concerned about at all. Now that you’ve had time to process this revelation, I hope you’ll continue writing poetry, perhaps with a newfound appreciation for the literary arts and what they have to offer.
